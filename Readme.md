# E-commerce Website (demo)

Small static e-commerce front-end template used for a class demo.

## Quick changes I made
- Added meta description and a few `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- Fixed header search markup.
- Added client-side newsletter subscribe confirmation.
- Small UI tweaks (product display improvements).

Open `index.html` in your browser to view locally.
